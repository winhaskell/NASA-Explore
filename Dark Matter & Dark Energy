Dark Matter & Dark Energy

Discover the universe's building blocks – matter, dark matter, and dark energy.

Matter is defined as any substance that has mass and occupies space.

Dark matter and dark energy are mysterious substances that affect and shape the cosmos, and scientists are still trying to figure them out.
