Journey to the Moon

On Thursday, Feb. 15, at 1:05 a.m. EST, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 launched Intuitive Machines' first lunar lander to the Moon's surface.
The lander is scheduled to land on the Moon’s South Pole region on Thursday, Feb. 22. The group of NASA instruments aboard the 
lander will conduct scientific research and demonstrate technologies to help us better understand the Moon’s environment and improve 
landing precision and safety in the challenging conditions of the lunar south polar region, paving the way for future Artemis astronaut missions.﻿
