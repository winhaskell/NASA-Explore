Climate change

Climate change is a long-term change in the average weather patterns that have come to define Earth’s local, regional and global climates. 
These changes have a broad range of observed effects that are synonymous with the term.

“Climate change” and “global warming” are often used interchangeably but have distinct meanings. Similarly, the terms "weather" and "climate" 
are sometimes confused, though they refer to events with broadly different spatial- and timescales.
