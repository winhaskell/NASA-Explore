UAP

Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) means (A) airborne objects that are not immediately identifiable; (B) transmedium objects or devices; 
(C) and submerged objects or devices that are not immediately identifiable and that display behavior or performance characteristics suggesting 
that the objects or devices may be related to the objects or devices described in subparagraph (A) or (B). (Per the NDAA FY23 Section 1673(d)(8)).

The DoD considers Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) as sources of anomalous detections in one or more domain (i.e., airborne, seaborne, 
spaceborne, and/or transmedium) that are not yet attributable to known actors and that demonstrate behaviors that are not readily understood by sensors or observers.

Common objects/causes frequently reported as UAP include:
- Airborne clutter  
- Commercial or scientific balloons
- Commercial or military aircraft
- Unmanned aerial vehicles (i.e., drones)
- Space launches 
- Satellites  
- Celestial objects
